      <h3>WELCOME TO THE WEIRD AND WONDERFUL WORLD OF INKBUS TATTOO</h3>
      <p>
        In 2016 L.A. native Markoon Dugally was in love with his life as a tattoo artist, but completely over the
        stifling
        nature of a brick and mortar store front. Inspiration struct, and various artistic disciplines collide as
        Markoon
        pulled from the collected experiences and learnings of his many creative endeavors to birth what is now the
        original
        INKBUS. Little did he suspect at that time a niche was also waiting to be filled: Impulse Tattoos. The scene was
        set
        — the bus was approachable, the intimidation-factor was low, the designs were juicy — and people flocked to him
        in
        droves, many for their first tattoo.
      </p>
      <p>Seven yeas later, INKBUS Tattoo is now a school bus-based tattoo company slinging ink and nostalgic experiences
        to
        the masses. Both static and mobile buses reside under the umbrella of the growing INKBUS brand. Be on the
        lookout
        for our signature purple buses at your local hotspots and events as this Portland based company expands into a
        city
        near you.
      </p>
      <p>Book a mobile tattoo bus today for your next big celebration, or come join us at one of our epic parties
        anchored
        by a static bus. We'll keep the ink warm for you…
