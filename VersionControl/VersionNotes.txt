03/25/23 Main index working in larger viewport siaes working perf. Inkbus About having issues with main area blowout. About to try configuring that <main> the same as <main> in index.html. Mobile view still needs help.

03/25/23 stackoverload question:
Issue: a \<main\> section that pushes up behind the \<header\> section on smaller veiwport sizes.

Building a fairly simple multi-page website, a \<body\> wrapper set to flex, with three flex items, \<header\>, \<main\>, \<footer\>,  and flex-direction: column. These are meant to be global elements that will carry the styling for all pages.  
  
The index.html page is working with two images of the same size contained in a css grid. In every direction, down to screen width 768px (I have not finished the mobile media queries yet), the images respond the way I would expect -- across all major browsers.

The aboutInkBus.html page does not. In an effort to standardize the process, I have made the two pages as alike as possible in their html and css design. However, the about page's two items in main -- an image and information copy -- are of different  sizes, which I suspect is part of the issue.

Here is the link to my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SevenRooT/InkBus2023). The pages in question are:

- [index.html](https://github.com/SevenRooT/InkBus2023/blob/main/index.html) 
- [aboutInkBus.html](https://github.com/SevenRooT/InkBus2023/blob/main/pages/main/aboutInkBus.html) 
- [main.css](https://github.com/SevenRooT/InkBus2023/blob/main/assets/styles/main.css) 

I have attempted a wide variety of fixes: clearing all styles from the \<main\> section, switching to flexbox, overflow, display: block, collapsing margins and borders... nothing stops the \<main\> section from pushing behind the \<header\> section as the screen size shrinks proportionally for smaller laptop viewports. nothing on the page is position: absolute.

Also: when changing the \<header\> position from fixed to relative, the \<main\> section just pops to the front of the \<header\> instead of behind.

I have also tried a variety of margins and paddings, but they have other implications at larger screen sizes. All I really want is for the \<main\> div to respect the boundaries of the \<header\>.

Notes:
- I am also using a [reset.css](https://github.com/SevenRooT/InkBus2023/blob/main/assets/styles/reset.css) file
- Still new-ish to GitHub, and my pages would not render correctly in their publisher. Sorry.
- If you are viewing the code live, I added the following snippet for debugging:
```
* {
  outline: 1px solid red;
}
```
